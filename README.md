# -ESILV---Python-for-data-analysis---project-2023

Final python project done by Charles Deliege and Arthur Clavier on the following dataset :  
Online News Popularity Data Set, url 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity'

To summarize our work : 

We firstly have imported the dataset, made sure that there was no unusable datas such as NaN values, then we created 2 new subsets. 
One with the values with few number of possible values (like binary values), and the other with values with a large possible number of different values trhat they can take. Plot them, plot the correlation between these variables and the target variable for more data visualization and removed the outliers.

Spliting data, applying 4 different models in regard to the ones used by the authors of the relevant papers, we changed hyperparameters on every model and compared our results with the ones obtained by the authors of the relevent papers
